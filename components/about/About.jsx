            As part of the global expansion plan, Tim Hortons opened its first
            Caf√© & Baked Shop in Dubai in September 2011, marking the first
            international step for this loved Canadian brand. The concept found
            immediate success, quickly expanding its network across the GCC. In
            the GCC, Tim Hortons is proud to partner operating through a master
            franchise agreement with The Apparel Group, a leading F&B player,
            head-quartered in Jebel Ali, Dubai.
